        <p>OpeNGE is a fully open source, GPL licensed Star Wars Galaxies Emulator based on the final publish. OpeNGE started in July 2014 with the aim to develop a stable and scalable Star Wars Galaxies Server Emulator written in Java and Python. The project was founded by ex-ProjectSWG developers who created the NGECore2 server core and engine and realised the design flaws within NGECore2 and the development management issues within ProjectSWG. As a result, instead of developing a semi or fully closed source server, we are fully open source and don't currently plan on hosting our own "play" server. Thus we are fully focused on the development of the server and not necessarily the community aspect.</p>

<p>Currently we are in very early stages of development and are still planning and designing the core systems of the server.</p>
